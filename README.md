# Computer-Graphics-in-Python
This repo contains several classic CG programs implemented by me in Python (with tkinter and matplotlib). Comments have been included with at most places for improved understanding.

Here's a list of programs in here:
- A simple program to see how things work. Plotting cirlce, ellipse, line using inbuilt functions.
- Plotting a point using custom function.
- DDA Line Algorithm
- Bresenham's Line Algorithm
- Mid point Cricle Algorithm
- Bresenham's Cricle Algorithm
- 2d transformation (translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, shearing)
- 2d composite transformations (translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, shearing)
- 3d composite transformations (translation, scaling, rotation)
- Creating a 3d object
- Mid point ellipse drawing algorithm
